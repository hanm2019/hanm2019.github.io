My name is Meng Han, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Integrated Circuits, Tsinghua University, working with Prof. [Leibo Liu](https://www.sic.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1014/1807.htm). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Architecture from Beihang University in 2025, where I was advised by Prof. [Limin Xiao](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2653.htm) and Prof. [Liang Wang](https://lwangbuaa.github.io/page/).

My research focuses on hardware accelerator for point clouds and DNNs. I have published several first-author/co-author papers in top conferences and journals, including ISCA, MICRO, IEEE TC, TCAD, DAC, DATE, JSA, and ASP-DAC.
